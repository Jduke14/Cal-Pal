  <h2>About Cal-Pal</h2>
      <h3>Developers</h3>
          <p>Cal-Pal started as a project for a computer science class at Louisiana State University. The goal was to create something longer and more complex than the students had attempted before. Classmates Devin Tullier, Josh Duke, Mark Thibodeaux, Chris Walker, and Eric Tran came up with Cal-Pal. </p>
